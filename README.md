# Project Title: Forward & Reverse Engineering in ArgoUML

## Creation Interval.
March 18, 2024 - March 18, 2024

## Description
This Git repository contains the project files for a task focused on forward and reverse engineering using ArgoUML. 
The task involves two main activities: forward engineering and reverse engineering using different technologies such as ArgoUML Dj Decompiler and others.

1. Forward Engineering:

- Class Diagrams Creation: Using ArgoUML, class diagrams are created with class structures including attributes, methods, and relationships.
- Java Class Generation: Based on the class diagrams created in ArgoUML, basic Java classes are generated using the "Generation" menu in ArgoUML.
- Compilation: The generated Java files are compiled to obtain the ".class" files.

2. Reverse Engineering:

- Decompilation: Utilizing tools such as DJ Decompiler, JAD, or similar, ".class" files are decompiled to obtain the corresponding ".java" files.
- Import and Class Diagram Creation: The decompiled ".java" files are imported into ArgoUML using the "File + Import Sources" option. Class diagrams are then created based on these imported files.
